    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I'm the @dopesaur, PHP developer. I stream development of my CMS (I call it Fuzzy) on <a href="https://www.livecoding.tv">livecoding.tv</a>. In this blog, I'll write about Fuzzy's development, PHP, JS, and about other interesting stuff I have stumbled on the internet.</p>
<h2>Few facts about me</h2>
<p>My biggest problem (right now) is managing bookmarks.
Yeah, my bookmark collection is scattered across several devices (laptop, phone, and tablet) and different browsers (every 1/3 a year a pick new browser from following list: FF, Chrome, Safari, and Opera), so I have something like 500 bookmarks scattered across whole bunch of devices/browsers.
Sometimes, I even keep them in Skype (4 fun).  </p>
<p>Do you know how it's hard to find a bookmark that I recalled?
Basically, I need either to google it (if I have enough of details on top of my head), or search through all my bookmarks on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phone (Safari)</li>
<li>Tablet (Safari)</li>
<li>Laptop
<ul>
<li>Safari</li>
<li>Chrome</li>
<li>Opera</li>
<li>Firefox</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and I forgot, I have few profiles on my computer, so I need to searched twice as much through my bookmarks. This situation reminds me of cross browser compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Oops, it's seems that I was carried away lol.</p>
