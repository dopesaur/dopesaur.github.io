    <p>Sometimes, when I read some articles about PHP (if you can call them articles lol), I stumble upon interesting PHP blogs on <a href="http://tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>.
There's variety of PHP blogs which take different side of spectrum, either embracing PHP, or <a href="http://www.bbspot.com/news/2000/6/php_suspend.html">discouraging from PHP</a>.
There's also blogs that make fun of PHP. Honestly, I like some of those jokes, haha. </p>
<p>This post is about the last type of PHP blogs on tumblr, about funny blogs.</p>
<h2>PHP: The Good Parts</h2>
<p>Our first candidate for PHP blog <em>of the year</em> is <a href="http://phpthegoodparts.tumblr.com">PHP: The Good Parts</a>. </p>
<p>At first sight, I didn't get the whole point, but then... after few minutes staring at the only blog post it has the "No posts yet" post, I get the idea.
I was like <em>literally</em> rolling on the floor, you should totally check all of its posts lol.</p>
<p>That's very interesting, how hilarious is combination of community state and a simple phrase "No posts yet" in the blog about PHP's Good Parts can create such comical effect, "such wow" the only thing I can say.</p>
<h2>No PHP</h2>
<p>The second candidate is ... pam, pam, pam ... <a href="http://nophp.ru">No PHP</a>. This blog is reaction gif type blog, there's not much of gifs yet, but they're hilarious!</p>
<p>Some of these gifs are outdated: the one about PHP documentation, and about PHP community, but who cares (unless you're offended by these gifs)? They're actually funny.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>: <a href="http://phpsadness.com">php sadness</a> is like No PHP, but without funny reaction gifs, however, there's more detailed explanation why specific PHP features sucks.</p>
<h2>PHP Manual Masterpieces</h2>
<p>The last and the third release candidate is <a href="http://phpmanualmasterpieces.tumblr.com">PHP Manual Masterpieces</a>. This blog is a collection of PHP official documentation flaws. Some of these flaws are really funny, especially this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DateTimeImmutable::modify()</p>
<p>Alters the timestamp. Like DateTime::modify() but works with DateTimeImmutable.</p>
<p>Duh. I don&rsquo;t see what&rsquo;s so hard about this, @pda.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t actually do what the name says and <strong>modify an unmodifiable</strong> object at all. So, at least there&rsquo;s that; PHP didn&rsquo;t actually go through with its threat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All I can say, those blogs are entertaining indeed.</p>
