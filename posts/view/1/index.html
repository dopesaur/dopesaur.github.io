        <p>This CMS is not actually one file. Its core and themes can be compressed down to one file, but it never would be one file because of assets and content (How would you put SQLite database in one file with CMS?! I'm crazy, but not that way crazy).</p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. </p>
